As an age-advanced, but not entirely adult being I was unprepared for the 
reality of my first age-appropriate purchase: TAXES. 
I am officially pissed at my 
government and want to know why the HELL I am paying for some sexist 
asshole with a gun, but sadly never a military badge to tweet, twat, and 
twatter on my time. Fuck Twitter. Fuck Facebook. Fuck the scourge of 
social media. And most importantly: FUCK DONALD TRUMP!! 

 -- Oh, oh and God bless America for allowing me to live after my die hard 
    expression of patriotism.
