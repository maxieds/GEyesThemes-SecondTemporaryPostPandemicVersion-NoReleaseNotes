I found an outline of a drippy, oozing-looking piece of icon clipart on 
FlatIcon.com which I thought needed to be properly morphed into a veined 
monster theme using the GIMP. This is the result. Note that the eyeball image 
is unusually large compared to the other themes for use on my 
"GEyesForAndroid" application which displays the higher resolutions better 
than stock Gnome does on the desktop. If you like the idea of this theme, 
try it out on your Droid phone (APK and downloads available from my 
GitHub page links).
