The Smashing Pumpkins recently (August 2018) broadcast one of their 
spectacular reunion shows live on Twitter. Since I am slow to adopt / do 
not as a general rule respect the platform of social media, I had to 
create an account on the site for the first time to make sure I didn't get 
locked out of the concert when it started airing. My first "tweet" was a 
promo endorsing the concert. It was liked by one person (only), and that 
person was a member of the band. In tribute to the awesome wall of sound the 
Pumpkins have put together this year to show that they've still got it, and 
let Billy Corgan assify himself as a rockstar once again this decade, I 
wanted to make pumpkin-themed eyeballs for this repo. This is what came out 
of the process. In actuality, it's probably one of the nicer looking themes 
I have created from a technical (graphic-design-lacking) perspective on my 
art portfolio. Run this on Halloween if you like, or bouncing your laptop 
to the drum sounds of "I Am One" (or the like).
