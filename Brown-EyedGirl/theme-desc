What I would consider the "default" counterpart to the standard Gnome 
eye themes for the ladies out there in Linux master land. This one goes out 
to the brown-eyed chica's out there. For other eye colors see the related and 
similarly named themes. Note that this line of styling is my attempt to 
gender neutralize one of my favorite small touches just for Linux users -- 
namely the GEyes panel applet which has been stock since, well, forever. 
Blue-eyed boys no longer dominate the range of customized human-loooking eyes.
