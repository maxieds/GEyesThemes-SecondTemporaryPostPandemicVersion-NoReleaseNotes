I periodically search around for novelty shoes and clothing related to 
math, computers, hardware, and my cats. There are nice pairs of circuit-board 
socks and flip flops which I have picked out for my cousin who will never 
order them for himself (go figure). Maybe I can get him to install this 
theme on whatever brand of Linux he's into nowadays... Cheers to Dave for 
inadvertantly inspiring this theme and his ability to best me for 
compiling kernels six months before I ordered my first copy of Mandrake 7.0 
off of Amazon as a 7-CD set.
