I wanted a cat theme with whiskers and pointy ears for occasional late-night 
kitty lap sessions coding with Kush. It turns out that the code for the 
GEyes plugin / panel applet is about as fool-proof as it comes in that it 
is written to support eye-pupil wall paddings for simple circular and 
ellipse-like structures. In particular, it does not allow one to 
adjust the padding between the edge of the eyeball image and the pupil 
image separately over common regions of the overal theme, i.e., adding 
ears and lower whiskers impairs the pupil range of motion so much that 
it really isn't currently worth it to have such a detailed cat theme. 
I'm still working out variants. The Cheshire Cat is famous, and I 
believe good spirited enough, to be added to the list of cat artwork that 
does fit into the standard-looking GEyes theme appearances. Just don't 
ever, ever make hime mad: he will swat at your mouse and riddle it into 
maddening disappearance.
