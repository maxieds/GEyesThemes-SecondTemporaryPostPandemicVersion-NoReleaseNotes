I want to point out to the cynics and over-assumers-under-observers out there 
that the eye border in green leaves on the eyeball for this theme are in 
fact innocuous *MAPLE* leaves, not that there is inherently anything wrong 
with the layperson's first impressions of this theme. It is not meant to 
be personal, and most certainly does not reflect the fine quality work 
of my former dental hygenist by the same spelling. Think foot and head 
style here if you would catch that vague reference to my sister^H^H...
