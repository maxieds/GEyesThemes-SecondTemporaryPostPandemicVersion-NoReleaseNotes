Valentine's Day themed eyes with heart pupils for inspriation or unoriginal 
fodder for techie romance. Named after the annoying baby with such a 
raging case of diaper rash that he takes it out on others by shooting them 
with poisoned arrows. No, the author is not a romantic a heart, just 
authentic. May the gesture get some poor sysadmin laid on one of Hallmark's 
trademark days of the year.
