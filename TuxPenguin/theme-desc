Less than perfect experiment with two eyes working from the same pupil 
image over top of a larger penguin body. The idea here is to pad the 
pupils so that they stay centered (roughly) in the eye portion of the 
body image and do not weirdly move around like possessed little spawned 
penguin processes run amok on my desktop. Needs to be revisited, but 
gives the obligtory tux theme for Linux users :)
