First the thought of this style, then to hippies, then to my sister's 
namesake theme. I dedicated an artistic creation inspired somewhere 
deep beneath my soul to her name -- and it's the thought that counts. 
This is easy enough to replicate in the GIMP. Also, the pupil's should 
probably be re-done to look less awkward in the future. My friend who 
tests all of my Droid apps on his iPhone says this is his favorite...
