One of the finest introduction to discrete math books ever printed is 
"Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science" by Graham, 
Knuth, and Patashnik. Its distinctive cover is always somewhere not too 
distant from my current workspace. This theme pays tribute to that 
wonderful book and is inspired by its hardcover art. Anyone who says 
"math is hard" is either genuinely too stupid to hold a pen to paper for the 
purposes of effective communication, is so uncreative that they cannot 
see past dy/dx to the good things in number theory, OR more likely, has 
never had a proper introduction to the material in this book as a mature 
undergrad student. I am open to more cases here, but I think this makes my 
point about why this theme needed to be birthed out from my GIMP one night.
