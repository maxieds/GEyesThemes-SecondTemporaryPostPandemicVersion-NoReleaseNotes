An obilgatory math inspired theme considering that I have eyeball sets 
honoring other, less attributed math constants where this one 
(\tau = 2\pi is a B.S. day for some snarky people who just have to be 
different) when presented with an irrational math/science holiday in the 
first place. In the sport of Hallmark days of the year which are 
still underappreciated, this one is King. Run this on 3/14/* for better luck 
than I had on the epic PI day whose time keeping is authentic to the 
numerical approximation of PI my several more digits.
