This theme is a tribute to one of my favorite mathematical constants, 
\zeta(3), also known as Apery's constant after the French mathematician who 
famously proved it to be irrational in the 1970's. The proof of the 
irrationality of this constant (whether it is indeed transcendental is still 
a big open problem amongst number theorists) relies on bounding the ratios 
of two integer (almost-integer) sequences defined by sums of binomial 
coefficients in a very clever, ingenious argument using well-known 
irrationality criteria. The so-termed even-indexed zeta constants, 
\zeta(2k) for k>=1 an integer, have been well recognized in closed-form as 
a transcendental sequences expressed by predictable rational multiples of 
powers of \pi. While the \zeta(2) case is certainly an interesting case, 
if nothing else than for the historical context and brilliant methematicians 
who trie to sum it exactly, this theme is inspired by the genuine oddness 
of this dual sequence to the classically identified cases! With luck to those 
who run this theme on their Linux in search of \zeta(5)!
