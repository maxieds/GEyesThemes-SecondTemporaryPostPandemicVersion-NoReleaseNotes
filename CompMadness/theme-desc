Kind of like "Space Madness" from the Ren and Stimpy show ... I've 
looked over so many comp prep problems over the past month, that I'm seeing 
all alegbra gradients and focusing in L^p norms, and their most useful cases, 
of course. Some people think it's funny when I say I'm ready for all this 
"madness" to be passed me.
