Another attempt at hommage to one of my other favorite mathematical constants. 
It shows up all over the place, from asymptotic ratios of the density of the 
squarefree integers to those that the Moebius function prefers to annihilate, 
to the approximation of the first-order hamonic numbers by 
H_n \sim \log(n) + \gamma, to fun yet challenging series and integrals 
that need its wonders to be summed in closed-form. This Euler-Gamma, or 
many times also Euler-Mascheroni, constant is approximately 0.577..., a 
pattern beginning a list of presumably irrational (non-repeating) digits. 
The theme has (like many \pi symbols) a spiral of truncated digits for the 
constant, and typeset \gamma eyeballs. It is recommended that you run this 
theme the night before your next calc exam for good luck and possibly 
bonus credit for non-trivial trivia about approximately how slowly the 
harmonic series diverges off to infinity.
