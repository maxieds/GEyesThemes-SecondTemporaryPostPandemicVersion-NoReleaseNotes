What I would consider the "default" counterpart to the standard Gnome 
eye themes for the ladies out there in Linux master land. This one goes out 
to the pink-eyed, contact wearing bunch out there. 
For other eye colors see the related and 
similarly named themes. Note that this line of styling is my attempt to 
gender neutralize one of my favorite small touches just for Linux users -- 
namely the GEyes panel applet which has been stock since, well, forever. 
Blue-eyed boys no longer dominate the range of customized human-loooking eyes. 

(N.b., upon request to have this theme included in the default gnome-applet 
distribution (again, as a fair touch for the *ladies* on Linux), some 
jerk said no. He should have his troll tail torched by a bunch of PMS-ing 
bitchy hacktresses of the night -- thus torturing him into submission so 
that the Gnome panel is integrated and gender neutral. Just AN opinion and 
thoughts of appreciation for the reactionary Linux as a boys club 
sentiments there. No really, don't kill him (it's illegal).)
