Technically these eyes look more like something out of an Aztec inspired 
wall mural in the southwest than something just for chicks. 
In other words, another eye-lash enhanced 
set of eyes for the Linux desktop. Not so special that it gets a clever or 
thoughtful name -- just cool enough that it need be included in the 
sequence of new themes. I personally like this one the best out of the 
Eye* sequence of themes so far -- for whatever that's worth.
