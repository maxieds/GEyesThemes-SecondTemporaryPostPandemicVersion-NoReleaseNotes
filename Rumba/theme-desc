As in appropriate of me as it may be for me to voice this out loud in 
virtually any other venue but here, I DO NOT LIKE THE EYES TANGO THEME, 
NOR DO I APPRECIATE THE BLUE-EYED MALE ASSHOLE OFFICE MATE I HAD WHO I 
BELIEVE INTRODUCED IT TO THE STOCK THEME FACTORY FOR MY FAVORITE LINUX 
DESKTOP APPLET!! Ever since Tango appeared on an obviously modified version 
of Linux Mint which I had left in modifyable format on a thumb drive in 
my old office some years ago, the gap in my infallable belief in the 
goodness on Linux as a pure thing that shouldn't be tampered with by 
outsiders was lodged. I hope this re-centers things in my psyche. 
If you appreciate this, or the other more creative and inspired themes 
in this ad hoc collection, smoke a smelly cigarette, or roll a joint out 
of some symbols on paper that look impressive if you think that it takes 
more brains than motivation and manipulations (in some rare cases) to get 
a high-order math degree -- and don't understand the "top-that-bitch" at 
any cost mentality that goes into the innovation of new caligraphic styles 
impressively spawned to describe mundane structures that have been studied 
before, but never from this novel new prespective of what I call them today! 
In other words, every one with a Ph.D. is not a smart person (necessarily 
at what they do, depending on as above how we interpret that phrase). 
The thought of that asshole and his matress firm and the ball-shaped 
blue eyes still piss me off -- even today. Run this theme to say FU to 
not just this asshole and master of everything Google can *train* you to 
make look well, but others like him that many of us have surely suffered. 
EOT.
