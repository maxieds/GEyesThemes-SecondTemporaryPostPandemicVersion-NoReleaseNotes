This was technically one of my first attempts at the themes for those of us 
humans with aesthtically pleasing internal plumbing (for girls / ladies / 
women). The original image was selected and feathered from a watermarked 
Shutterstock art stock which led to awkward eyelash definitions which were 
subsequently blurred with filters until looking distinctive. Not my 
finest eye theme artwork attempt, but I still like it too much to throw it 
out. The rainbow-themed pupils give it some distinctive character.
