Most people are familiar with the Hollywood spectacle brought forth by this 
movie a long time ago. I associate saying the name "Beetle Juice" a predictable 
number of times in a row with the devil himself appearing in "Gotcha!" 
fashion. Because I am naturally skeptical, and also as it happens, a smart ass 
by nature, I crafted this eye theme while studying for my algebra quals 
thinking that even though I had by all means adequately prepared myself for 
the upcoming exam, there might still be some special Hell to pay in the 
form of an incomprehensibly difficult exam. It turns out the latter is the 
case and almost all students failed the "easy" qual exam to pass at my 
school. Running this theme has been since de-cursed (since I was right) and 
will ward off evil spirits and problem sets. Enjoy!
